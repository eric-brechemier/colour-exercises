## Chapter 1: What is Color?

### Exercises

**1. Observe an object under different lighting conditions,
   and, if you can, take some color photographs.
   How do the different conditions affect its color?**

All pictures were taken on April 30th, 2015, with a Panasonic DMC-GX1
using iA mode (automatic exposure). The camera is pointed towards the South.
The weather was cloudy, with a sunny spell around 4PM. The pictures
were scaled down to 200x150px with 300 pixels/inch and saved as JPEG
with 100% quality using Gimp.

The sequence shows pictures taken at: 9AM, 12AM, 4.30PM (sunny), 7PM, 8.30PM.
